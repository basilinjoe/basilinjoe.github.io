# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a popular React framework that makes building web applications a breeze.

## Why Next.js?

1. Server-side rendering out of the box
2. File-based routing
3. API routes
4. Great developer experience

## Setup

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies.
